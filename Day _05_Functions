#DAY 05 Python IDC 30 Days CHALLENGE.

#Topics-Defining functions, parameters, return values, lambda functions.

# Challenge-Write a function that computes the sum and average of a list of numbers

# Define a function to calculate sum and average
def calculate_sum_and_average(numbers):
    # Calculate the total sum
    total = sum(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the average
    average = total / len(numbers)
    
    # Return both values
    return total, average

# Take user input as space-separated numbers
user_input = input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ")

# Convert the input into a list of float numbers
num_list = [float(num) for num in user_input.split()]

# Call the function and store the result
total, avg = calculate_sum_and_average(num_list)

# Print the results
print("Sum:", total)
print("Average:", avg)
