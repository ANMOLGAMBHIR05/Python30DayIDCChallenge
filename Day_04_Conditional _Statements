#DAY 04 Python IDC 30 Days CHALLENGE.

#Topics-If-else, for/while loops, break/continue

#Challenge-Check if a user-entered number is prime

# Get input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Prime numbers are greater than 1
if num <= 1:
    print("Not a prime number")
else:
    # Check for divisors
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            # Found a divisor; so it's not a prime
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        # This else belongs to the for loop, not the if
        # It executes only if the loop didn't break (i.e., no factors found)
        print(num, "is a prime number")
